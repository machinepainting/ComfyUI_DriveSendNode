**Encryption is completely optional.** If you don't need it, simply leave `enable_encryption` off and your files upload directly to Google Drive as-is. Enable encryption only if you want an extra layer of security for your files in cloud storage.

## 📤📦 Features

- **📤📦 DriveSend AutoUploader Node**
  Automatically uploads newly created files to Google Drive with optional file encryption capabilities.

  - Monitors a specified folder (e.g., ComfyUI's `output/`) in real time, with optional recursive subfolder monitoring.
  - Supports common ComfyUI file types: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.webp`, `.gif`, `.mp4`, `.avi`, `.mov`.
  - Optional encryption of files before upload, creating `.enc` files using a secure Fernet key (AES-128).
  - Configurable toggles for:
    - `enable_encryption`: Encrypt files before upload (default: off).
    - `Post_Delete_Enc`: Delete encrypted `.enc` files after upload verification (default: off).
    - `Subfolder_Monitor`: Monitor subfolders in the watch directory (default: on).
    - `run_process`: Start or stop the monitoring and uploading process (default: on).
  - Uses a queue system to ensure reliable processing of files, even under high load, preventing skipped files.
  - Verifies upload integrity using SHA256 checksums to ensure files are not corrupted during transfer.

- **🛠️📦 DriveSend Setup Node**
  Streamlines Google Drive API access setup and encryption key management.

  - Supports two authentication methods:
    - **Service Account** (Recommended for cloud/RunPod): No browser interaction needed after initial setup.

  - Provides API credentials and optional encryption key for easy integration into Environment Variables and RunPod Secrets.
  - Supports two storage methods:
    - `env_file`: Saves credentials to a `.env` file (recommended for local user setups).
    - `display_only`: Displays credentials in the console for manual copying (recommended for cloud setups like RunPod).
  - Supports three encryption key methods:
    - `off`: No encryption key is generated (use if encryption is not needed).
    - `Display Only`: Displays the encryption key in the console with other credentials.
    - `save to .env`: Saves the encryption key to the `.env` file.

- **🔐📁 Standalone Decryption Scripts (Local Use Only)**
  Decrypt `.enc` files on your local machine using the included scripts in the `/scripts/` folder.

  - **Local use only** — Run these on your computer after downloading/syncing encrypted files from Google Drive.
  - Cross-platform support for macOS, Windows, and Linux.
  - Restores encrypted files back to their original format (PNG, JPG, MP4, etc.).
  - Supports recursive folder processing.
  - Option to organize `.enc` files after decryption.
  - Includes optional encryption scripts for manual local encryption (not needed for normal DriveSend operation).

## 🏃‍♂️‍➡️🫛📦 DriveSend Setup Node Instructions (RunPod & Cloud Users)

Using Service Account authentication (recommended for cloud):

1. Upload your `service_account.json` to a secure location on your pod, or encode it as base64 and store as an environment variable.

2. Open the 'DriveSend Setup Node' in your ComfyUI and configure:

   - `auth_method`              [ service_account ]
   - `service_account_json`     [ path to service_account.json OR leave blank if using env var ]
   - `folder_id`                [ paste your Google Drive folder ID ]
   - `storage_method`           [ display_only ]
   - `encryption_key_method`    [ Display Only ] (or off if not needed)

3. Click 'Run' on the node. Note the returned credentials in the terminal:

```bash
GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON=<base64 encoded or path>
comfyui_encryption_key=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (if encryption enabled)
```

4. For RunPod users, create secrets:

   | Secret Name | Secret Value |
   |-------------|--------------|
   | `GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID` | Your folder ID |
   | `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` | Base64-encoded service account JSON |
   | `comfyui_encryption_key` | Your encryption key (if using encryption) |

5. Add Environment Variables to your RunPod Pod:
   - `GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID` → `{{ RUNPOD_SECRET_GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID }}`
   - `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` → `{{ RUNPOD_SECRET_GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON }}`
   - `comfyui_encryption_key` → `{{ RUNPOD_SECRET_comfyui_encryption_key }}`

6. Add the DriveSend AutoUploader Node to your workflow and run!

## 🛠️💻📦 DriveSend Setup Node Instructions (Local Computer Users)

Using OAuth 2.0 authentication:

1. Place your `credentials.json` in the `ComfyUI_DriveSendNode` folder

2. Open the 'DriveSend Setup Node' in your ComfyUI and configure:

   - `auth_method`              [ oauth ]
   - `folder_id`                [ paste your Google Drive folder ID ] (optional - uploads to root if blank)
   - `storage_method`           [ env_file ]
   - `encryption_key_method`    [ save to .env ] (or off if not needed)

3. Click 'Run' on the node. A browser window will open for Google authentication.

4. After authenticating, a `token.json` file will be created automatically.

5. Restart ComfyUI and add the DriveSend AutoUploader Node to your workflow.

## 🔑📦 Encryption Key Management

If you enable encryption in the DriveSend AutoUploader Node, an encryption key is generated during setup (unless `encryption_key_method` is `off`). This key is **required** to decrypt `.enc` files downloaded from Google Drive.

### Saving the Encryption Key

**Display Only (Recommended for Cloud):**

If `encryption_key_method` is `Display Only`, the key is shown in the console:

```
comfyui_encryption_key=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

Copy the key and store it securely using one of the methods below.

**Save to .env (Recommended for Local):**

If `encryption_key_method` is `save to .env`, the key is saved in `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI_DriveSendNode/.env` as:

```
comfyui_encryption_key=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

Ensure the `.env` file is excluded from version control (add to `.gitignore`).

## 🔐📁 Standalone Decryption Scripts (Local Use Only)

The `/scripts/` folder contains standalone scripts to decrypt files on your **local machine**.

> ⚠️ **These scripts are for LOCAL USE ONLY.** Run them on your personal computer after downloading or syncing encrypted files from Google Drive. Do not run on cloud instances.

> 💡 **Universal Compatibility:** These scripts work with both DriveSend (Google Drive) and DropSend (Dropbox) nodes. They use the same encryption key (`comfyui_encryption_key`), so you only need to set up key storage once.

### What Are These Scripts For?

**Decryption Scripts** — The primary scripts. Use these on your local machine to decrypt `.enc` files you've downloaded/synced from Google Drive. When encryption is enabled in the DriveSend node, your files are uploaded as encrypted `.enc` files. These scripts restore them to their original format so you can view and use them.

**Encryption Scripts** — Optional utility scripts. You do NOT need these for normal DriveSend operation—the node handles encryption automatically during upload. These are provided for users who want to manually encrypt local files for backup or other purposes using the same key.

### Supported File Types

The scripts support all formats the DriveSend node handles:

- Images: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.webp`, `.gif`
- Videos: `.mp4`, `.avi`, `.mov`

When decrypting, the original file extension is preserved (e.g., `video.mp4.enc` → `video.mp4`).

### Prerequisites (All Platforms)

**Python 3.8+** and the **cryptography** library are required:

```bash
pip install cryptography
```

## 🍎 macOS Setup & Usage

### Storing Your Encryption Key in Keychain

1. Open **Keychain Access** (search in Spotlight)
2. Click **File > New Password Item**
3. Fill in the fields:
   - **Keychain Item Name:** `ComfyUI_Encryption_Key`
   - **Account Name:** `ComfyUI`
   - **Password:** Paste your encryption key
4. Click **Add**

To retrieve later: Search for `ComfyUI_Encryption_Key` in Keychain Access, double-click, check **Show Password**, and authenticate.

### Running the Scripts

1. Navigate to the scripts folder:
   ```bash
   cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI_DriveSendNode/scripts
   ```

2. Make the script executable (first time only):
   ```bash
   chmod +x decrypt_folder_mac.sh
   chmod +x encrypt_folder_mac.sh
   ```

3. Run the decryption script:
   ```bash
   ./decrypt_folder_mac.sh
   ```

4. When prompted:
   - Drag and drop the folder containing `.enc` files into the terminal, or type the path
   - Choose whether to process subfolders recursively (Y/N)
   - Optionally move `.enc` files to a separate folder after decryption

---

## 🪟 Windows Setup & Usage

### Storing Your Encryption Key

**Using Environment Variable (Recommended):**

1. Press `Win + R`, type `sysdm.cpl`, press Enter
2. Go to **Advanced** tab → **Environment Variables**
3. Under **User variables**, click **New**
4. Set:
   - **Variable name:** `COMFYUI_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
   - **Variable value:** Your encryption key
5. Click **OK** to save
6. Restart any open terminals/command prompts

### Running the Scripts

1. Open **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell**

2. Navigate to the scripts folder:
   ```cmd
   cd ComfyUI\custom_nodes\ComfyUI_DriveSendNode\scripts
   ```

3. Run the decryption script:
   ```cmd
   python decrypt_folder_win.py
   ```

4. When prompted:
   - Enter the full path to the folder containing `.enc` files
   - Choose whether to process subfolders recursively (Y/N)
   - Optionally move `.enc` files to a separate folder after decryption

---

## 🐧 Linux Setup & Usage

### Storing Your Encryption Key

**Option A: Environment Variable (Recommended)**

Add to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
export COMFYUI_ENCRYPTION_KEY="your_encryption_key_here"
```

Then reload:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

**Option B: Secret Service (GNOME Keyring / KWallet)**

If you have `secret-tool` installed (comes with `libsecret-tools`):

```bash
# Store the key
echo -n "your_encryption_key_here" | secret-tool store --label="ComfyUI Encryption Key" service ComfyUI username ComfyUI

# Retrieve the key (for verification)
secret-tool lookup service ComfyUI username ComfyUI
```

Install secret-tool if needed:

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install libsecret-tools

# Fedora
sudo dnf install libsecret

# Arch
sudo pacman -S libsecret
```

### Running the Scripts

1. Navigate to the scripts folder:
   ```bash
   cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI_DriveSendNode/scripts
   ```

2. Make the script executable (first time only):
   ```bash
   chmod +x decrypt_folder_linux.sh
   chmod +x encrypt_folder_linux.sh
   ```

3. Run the decryption script:
   ```bash
   ./decrypt_folder_linux.sh
   ```

4. When prompted:
   - Enter the full path to the folder containing `.enc` files
   - Choose whether to process subfolders recursively (Y/N)
   - Optionally move `.enc` files to a separate folder after decryption

---

## 🔄 Cross-Platform Python Script (Alternative)

For maximum compatibility, use the Python script directly on any platform:

```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI_DriveSendNode/scripts
python decrypt_folder.py
```

This script will:

1. Automatically detect your operating system
2. Check for your encryption key (environment variable, Keychain, or Secret Service)
3. Prompt for the key if not found
4. Process all `.enc` files and restore them to their original format

---

## ⚠️ Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit your `.env` file** - Ensure `.env` is in your `.gitignore`
2. **Never commit `service_account.json` or `credentials.json`** - These contain sensitive credentials
3. **Never commit `token.json`** - This contains your OAuth tokens
4. **Use secure key storage** - Prefer OS-native credential storage over plain text files
5. **Backup your encryption key** - Without it, encrypted files cannot be recovered
6. **Restrict service account permissions** - Only share specific folders, not your entire Drive

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Using Both DriveSend and DropSend

If you use both nodes (DriveSend for Google Drive and [DropSend](https://github.com/machinepainting/ComfyUI_DropSendNode) for Dropbox), you only need to store your encryption key **once** using any of the methods above. The scripts check for multiple key names for backward compatibility:

- `COMFYUI_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (recommended)
- `comfyui_encryption_key`
- `DRIVESEND_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (legacy)
- `DROPSEND_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (legacy)

The same applies to Keychain/Secret Service - the scripts will find your key regardless of which name you used.

### Running Both Nodes Simultaneously

If you have both DriveSend and DropSend installed and want to use them at the same time, configure them to watch **different folders** to avoid conflicts. For example:

- DriveSend watches: `ComfyUI/output/gdrive/`
- DropSend watches: `ComfyUI/output/dropbox/`

Or simply use one node at a time by setting `run_process` to `False` on the node you're not using.
